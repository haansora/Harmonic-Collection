                    <h2>Why Care So Much about Titles?</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Among all kinds of logo designs, movie titles are unique. <br> Most product logos remain the same language, no matter where they get exported. But movie titles <em>have</em> to be translated. When translated, movie titles have two tasks to fulfill: <strong>1&#41; to take the same brand identity as the original,</strong> and <strong>2&#41; to give the same feeling in a different cultural context.</strong> 
                    Graphic design is challenging, and making them international is even more so. Naturally, not all examples nail these tasks.

                    <div class="image-caption">
                        <p>In this example, the English version of the logo has very little in common with the original. The original title is inspired by Korean calligraphy, giving a fluid and nostalgic look. On the contrary, the English version is a rigid sans-serif. As a result, <strong>the two logos feel completely different despite carrying the same meanings.</strong> </p>

                    <div class="image-caption">
                        <p>In this example, <strong>the main identity of the logo has been taken away in translation.</strong> The English logo has prominent circular shapes throughout, similar to how the minions look. However, the Korean version is mainly rectangular which makes the title look more dull. </p>

                        <p>This is a successful example of translating both the words and the designs. Both versions of the titles are made of serif fonts with sharp edges, resembling a sword. One of the Ls is flipped with its serif at the bottom, which is a design choice reflected in the original title as well. <strong>They not only look alike but convey the message of the title in similar ways.</strong>

                    <h2>What’s Great about International Designs? 
                    </h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Movie titles are works of art that represent the movie. Adaptations of them should be done in honor of the original work, rather than just for the sake of translating. <strong>With a successful adaptation, the designer isn’t just translating the words but also the design itself.</strong> <br>It helps people enjoy works from abroad in a way it was intended. Making designs universal in different languages and cultures is becoming more necessary than ever. That’s why Titles Translated is here to showcase successful examples of international designs, so you can become a more versatile graphic designer.
