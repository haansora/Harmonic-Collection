                    <h2>Why Care So Much about Titles?</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Among all kinds of logo designs, movie titles are unique. <br> Most product logos remain the same language, no matter where they get exported. But movie titles <em>have</em> to be translated. When translated, movie titles have two tasks to fulfill: <strong>1&#41; to take the same brand identity as the original,</strong> and <strong>2&#41; to give the same feeling in a different cultural context.</strong> 
                    Graphic design is challenging, and making them international is even more so. Naturally, not all examples nail these tasks.

                    <h2>What’s Great about International Designs? 
                    </h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Movie titles are works of art that represent the movie. Adaptations of them should be done in honor of the original work, rather than just for the sake of translating. <strong>With a successful adaptation, the designer isn’t just translating the words but also the design itself.</strong> <br>It helps people enjoy works from abroad in a way it was intended. Making designs universal in different languages and cultures is becoming more necessary than ever. That’s why Titles Translated is here to showcase successful examples of international designs, so you can become a more versatile graphic designer.
